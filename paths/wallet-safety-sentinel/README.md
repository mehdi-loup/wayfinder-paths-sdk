# Wallet Safety Sentinel

Continuously monitors a wallet for risky token approvals and drainer exposure — unlimited ERC-20 allowances, ERC-721/1155 ApprovalForAll, and unverified or known-malicious spenders. Scores wallet safety, surfaces a prioritized revoke list ranked by dollars at risk, and alerts on newly appeared or worsened risk. Read-only analysis; revokes are explicit, gated actions.

## What’s inside

- `wfpath.yaml` (path manifest)
- `scripts/main.py` (main component)
- `skill/instructions.md` (canonical skill instructions, optional)
- `applet/` (presentation UI, scaffolded by default; use `--no-applet` only when intentionally omitting it)

## Build

```bash
wayfinder path fmt --path .
wayfinder path doctor --path .
wayfinder path render-skill --path .
wayfinder path build --path . --out dist/bundle.zip
```

## Publish

```bash
export WAYFINDER_PATHS_API_URL="https://strategies-dev.wayfinder.ai"
export WAYFINDER_API_KEY="wk_..."
wayfinder path publish --path .
```

For bonded publishes:

```bash
wayfinder path publish --path . --bonded --owner-wallet 0xYourWallet --risk-tier execution
```

`wayfinder path publish` builds `bundle.zip` and `source.zip`, generates thin skill exports when this path has a skill, requests signed upload URLs from the Paths API, uploads artifacts directly to storage, then finalizes the submission and prints a manage URL plus the next required action.

## Delta Lab applets

If this path includes a presentation applet:

- use the public Delta Lab timeseries endpoint for browser reads:
  - prod: `https://strategies.wayfinder.ai/api/v1/delta-lab/public/assets/<symbol>/timeseries/`
  - dev: `https://strategies-dev.wayfinder.ai/api/v1/delta-lab/public/assets/<symbol>/timeseries/`
- if the applet is embedded by the Strategies path page, same-origin `/api/v1/delta-lab/public/assets/<symbol>/timeseries/` is acceptable
- prefer the host-provided base URL from the bridge (`wf:state.apiBase`, then `wf:hello` origin) instead of hardcoding or probing multiple environments
- do not probe both dev and prod from the same applet build
- do not call `/api/v1/delta-lab/symbols/`; it does not exist
- treat non-200 responses, especially `404`, as expected unavailability and show a data-unavailable state instead of crashing
- ensure every referenced file exists under `applet/dist/`
- include explicit `icon`, `shortcut icon`, and `apple-touch-icon` tags in the applet HTML to avoid implicit browser favicon 404s
