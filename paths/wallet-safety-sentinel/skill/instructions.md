# Wallet Safety Sentinel

Use this skill when you need to inspect, install, or operate the `wallet-safety-sentinel` path.

## What this skill does
- Explains what the path is for
- Points to the main component and supporting files in `path/`
- Uses the bundled runtime entrypoint in `scripts/wf_run.py`
- Summarizes the expected result of running the path
- Explains how to republish the path from the repo when asked

## Steps
1. Verify the path manifest and any required configuration.
2. Inspect the main component at `path/scripts/main.py`.
3. Run the requested execution path with `python scripts/wf_run.py -- --help` or the task-specific arguments you need.
4. Summarize what changed and any next actions.

## If you need to publish this path
1. Confirm the path includes a browser applet, or explicitly ask the owner before publishing without one.
2. Run `wayfinder path fmt --path .` and `wayfinder path doctor --path .`.
3. Set `WAYFINDER_PATHS_API_URL` to the target Strategies backend and set `WAYFINDER_API_KEY` if that environment requires auth.
4. Run `wayfinder path publish --path .` for a normal publish, or add `--bonded --owner-wallet 0x... --risk-tier ...` for a bonded publish.
5. The CLI will build `bundle.zip` and `source.zip`, generate thin skill exports, request signed upload URLs from the Paths API, upload artifacts directly to object storage, then finalize the submission.
6. Report the returned `manageUrl`, `reviewState`, `publishState`, and `nextAction` to the user.
7. If `ownerLinkRequired` is `true`, tell the owner to link the wallet and post the required bond. If `reviewState` is `review`, point them to the submissions page for recommended changes.

## Delta Lab note
- Use authenticated `DELTA_LAB_CLIENT` or `${system.api_base_url}/delta-lab/...` for scripts, server-side logic, and agent-side Python.
- For browser presentation on prod, use `https://strategies.wayfinder.ai/api/v1/delta-lab/public/assets/<symbol>/timeseries/`.
- For browser presentation on dev, use `https://strategies-dev.wayfinder.ai/api/v1/delta-lab/public/assets/<symbol>/timeseries/`.
- If the applet is embedded by the Strategies path page, same-origin `/api/v1/delta-lab/public/assets/<symbol>/timeseries/` is fine.
- Prefer the host bridge base URL (`wf:state.apiBase`, then `wf:hello` origin) instead of hardcoding or probing environments.
- Do not probe multiple environments from one applet build, and do not call `/api/v1/delta-lab/symbols/`.
- Treat non-200 responses, especially `404`, as data unavailability and render a safe fallback UI.
- Ensure every referenced file exists in `applet/dist/`, and include explicit `icon`, `shortcut icon`, and `apple-touch-icon` tags in the applet HTML to avoid implicit browser favicon 404s.
