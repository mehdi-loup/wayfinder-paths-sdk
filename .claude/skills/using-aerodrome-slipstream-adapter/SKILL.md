## When to use

Use this skill when you are:
- Reading Slipstream pool, gauge, and deployment-aware market data on Base
- Discovering concentrated-liquidity pools, selecting the best pool for a pair, or inspecting a specific NFT position
- Running range, volume, fee APR, volatility, or in-range probability analytics on a Slipstream pool
- Minting, increasing, decreasing, collecting, or burning Slipstream positions
- Staking LP NFT positions into gauges and claiming position rewards
- Managing veAERO locks, votes, and reward-claim flows that also apply to Slipstream gauges

Use the classic Aerodrome skill instead when the pool is a stable/volatile V2
pool, the position is an ERC20 LP balance, or the workflow is classic LP
add/remove/stake without a tick range or NFPM token id.
