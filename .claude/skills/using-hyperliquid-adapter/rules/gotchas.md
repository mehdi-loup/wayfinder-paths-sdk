# Hyperliquid gotchas

## Minimum amounts

| Type         | Minimum          | Notes                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Deposit      | $5 USD           | Deposits below this threshold are **lost** |
| Order (perp) | $10 USD notional | Applies to all perp markets                |
| Order (spot) | $10 USD notional | Applies to all spot markets                |

Constants available in `wayfinder_paths.core.constants.hyperliquid`:

- `MIN_DEPOSIT_USD = 5.0`
- `MIN_ORDER_USD_NOTIONAL = 10.0`

## UnifiedAccount mode is the default

All accounts touched by this adapter run in **UnifiedAccount mode**, where spot tokens and perp margin share collateral. The adapter auto-enables this before any order (`place_market_order`, `place_limit_order`, `place_tp_sl_order`, `place_outcome_order`) via `ensure_unified_account(address)` — one-time on-chain action per account, stays enabled afterward. As a consequence:

- Deposits land in the unified balance; no spot ↔ perp transfers needed.
- HIP-3 dexes (xyz, flx, vntl, hyna, km, …) are unlocked. HIP-3 asset IDs use offsets (first builder dex starts at 110000, then 120000, 130000, …) and coin names are prefixed (`xyz:NVDA`, `vntl:SPACEX`, `hyna:BTC`, …).

## Asset ID conventions

- Perp assets: `asset_id < 10000`
- Spot assets: `asset_id >= 10000`

Spot "index" is usually: `spot_index = spot_asset_id - 10000`.

## Spot trading gotchas

**Available spot pairs are limited.** Common assets like BTC and ETH are NOT directly available. Instead:

- Use `UBTC/USDC` for wrapped BTC
- Use `UETH/USDC` for wrapped ETH
- `HYPE/USDC` is native and available
- `PURR/USDC` is the OG spot pair (index 0)

**Asset-name resolution:** Always pass the canonical name from `hyperliquid_search_market` — `HYPE-USDC` (perp), `HYPE/USDC` (spot), `xyz:SP500` (HIP-3), `#200` (HIP-4). The tool reads the market type from the format; there's no `is_spot` flag.

**Spot orders don't use leverage:**

- `usd_amount` is always treated as notional (no `usd_amount_kind` required)
- `leverage` and `reduce_only` are ignored for spot

## Spot L2 naming quirks

The adapter implements special naming for spot orderbooks:

- spot_index == 0 uses `"PURR/USDC"`
- otherwise uses `"@{spot_index}"`

If you request spot data by coin string, prefer the helper mapping from `get_spot_assets()`.

## Executor wiring

Execution is intentionally separated from data:

- Read methods work with `Info` only.
- Write methods require an executor with signing configured.

## Funding history API surface

- There is no `HyperliquidAdapter.get_funding_history(...)` method in this repo.
- Funding time-series lives in:
  - `HyperliquidDataClient.get_funding_history(...)` (Wayfinder API), or
  - the underlying SDK `Info.funding_history(...)` via `adapter.info.funding_history(...)`.

## `info.funding_history()` is sync — parallelize with ThreadPoolExecutor

All `Info` methods are synchronous. Fetching funding history for many coins sequentially is slow. Use `run_in_executor` to parallelize:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as pool:
    futures = {
        coin: loop.run_in_executor(pool, info.funding_history, coin, start_ms, end_ms)
        for coin in coins
    }
    for coin, fut in futures.items():
        rates = await fut
```

## Enumerating all perp coins from metadata

`info.meta_and_asset_ctxs()` returns `[meta, asset_ctxs]`. The coin list and current funding are in parallel arrays:

```python
meta, ctxs = info.meta_and_asset_ctxs()
for i, asset in enumerate(meta["universe"]):
    coin = asset["name"]
    current_funding = float(ctxs[i]["funding"])  # hourly rate as decimal
```

## Funding rate is hourly — annualize with `* 24 * 365`

Hyperliquid settles funding every hour. The `fundingRate` field is the per-hour rate as a decimal (e.g. `0.0001` = 0.01%/hr). To annualize: `rate * 24 * 365`. Don't confuse with 8h-settlement exchanges (Binance, Aster) which use `* 3 * 365`.

## Builder fee approvals

Hyperliquid builder fees are opt-in per **user ↔ builder** pair:

- You must approve a max builder fee via `approve_builder_fee(builder, max_fee_rate, address)` before trades can include a builder.
- The fee value `f` is in **tenths of a basis point** (e.g. `30` → `0.030%`).
- This repo attributes trades to `0xaA1D89f333857eD78F8434CC4f896A9293EFE65c` (builder wallet is fixed; other addresses are rejected).

## USD sizing: notional vs margin (collateral)

When a user asks for “a **$X bet** at **Y× leverage**”, clarify whether `$X` is:

- **notional** (position size): `margin ≈ notional / leverage`
- **margin** (collateral): `notional = margin * leverage`

Claude Code MCP:

- `hyperliquid_place_market_order(usd_amount=..., usd_amount_kind="notional"|"margin", leverage=...)` (same args on `_place_limit_order`)
- If `usd_amount_kind="margin"`, `leverage` is required.
- If you provide `size`, it is **coin units**, not USD.

Best practice:

- Keep execution behind a single, clearly named entrypoint (strategy method or one-off `.wayfinder_runs/` script) and gate it with clear user intent + safety checks.
