## When to use

Use this skill when you are:
- Reading classic Aerodrome pool, gauge, Sugar, and route data on Base
- Ranking classic pools with Sugar epochs or emissions-based analytics
- Quoting or executing LP add/remove, unstaked fee claims, and gauge stake flows
- Inspecting wallet LP balances, staked LP balances, veAERO NFTs, or vote claimables
- Managing veAERO locks, lock extensions, permanent locks, votes, and reward claims

Use the Slipstream skill instead when the pool is a concentrated-liquidity pool,
has a `CL...` symbol, requires a tick spacing, or involves an NFPM token id.
