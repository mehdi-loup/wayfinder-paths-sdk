# Polymarket reads (markets + orderbooks + time series)

## Data accuracy (no guessing)

- Do **not** invent prices, time series, or market status. Fetch via the adapter.
- When endpoints fail, report “unavailable” and include the exact script/call needed to retry.

## MCP shortcuts (Claude Code)

- Search markets/events: `mcp__wayfinder__polymarket_read(action="search", query="bitcoin daily", limit=10)` (compact `candidates` by default)
- Trending markets: `mcp__wayfinder__polymarket_read(action="trending", limit=25)` (compact `candidates` by default)
- Event candidates: `mcp__wayfinder__polymarket_read(action="get_event", event_slug="...", candidate_limit=5)`
- Market metadata by slug: `mcp__wayfinder__polymarket_read(action="get_market", market_slug="...")` (bounded rules/description by default)
- Book-based trade quote: `mcp__wayfinder__polymarket_read(action="quote", market_slug="...", outcome="YES", side="BUY", buy_amount_pusd=100)`
- Price history (token_id): `mcp__wayfinder__polymarket_read(action="price_history", token_id="...", interval="1d", fidelity=5)`
- Full user status: `mcp__wayfinder__polymarket_get_state(wallet_label="main")`

Use `summary=False` only when debugging raw Gamma/backend behavior or when a needed field is missing from the compact response.

## Primary sources (in this repo)

- Adapter: `wayfinder_paths/adapters/polymarket_adapter/adapter.py`
- Adapter docs: `wayfinder_paths/adapters/polymarket_adapter/README.md`
- Constants (addresses + base URLs): `wayfinder_paths/core/constants/polymarket.py`

## Mental model (IDs you will see)

- **Market slug** (Gamma): use `get_market_by_slug(slug)` and show to users.
- **CLOB token id** (Gamma `clobTokenIds`): one per outcome; use for CLOB price/book/history and for trading.
- **ConditionId** (Gamma `conditionId`): on-chain identifier; use for redemption after resolution.

## Recommended market discovery flow

1) Start with compact MCP discovery:
   - `polymarket_read(action="search", query=..., limit=10)`
   - or `polymarket_read(action="get_event", event_slug=..., candidate_limit=5)` when you already know the event slug.
2) Pick the candidate by `slug`, `question`, outcome labels/token IDs, `resolvesAt`, liquidity, spread, and tradability flags. The compact `outcomes[]` shape handles binary and multi-outcome markets.
3) Hydrate the selected market:
   - `polymarket_read(action="get_market", market_slug=...)`
4) Only then fetch book/quote/history for the selected outcome token. Avoid raw event payloads in normal agent context; use `summary=False` only for debugging or missing-field investigation.

Practical note: Gamma often returns `outcomes`, `outcomePrices`, and `clobTokenIds` as JSON-encoded strings. The adapter normalizes these into Python lists.

## Time series (CLOB `prices-history`)

Use `get_prices_history(token_id=..., ...)`:

- `hist["history"]` is a list of `{ "t": <unix_ts>, "p": <price> }`
- Treat `p` as **implied probability** (0–1)

If you’re analyzing a market by slug, use `get_market_prices_history(market_slug=..., outcome=...)` (slug → token id → history).

## Book-based quote vs price

- Use `quote_market_order(token_id=..., side="BUY" | "SELL", amount=...)` in scripts when you need average execution from the current book.
- In MCP, use `buy_amount_pusd` for BUY quotes and `sell_amount_shares` for SELL quotes.
- BUY amount is pUSD spend; SELL amount is shares to sell. Do not describe a BUY as "N shares @ price" unless the share count comes from `executionSummary.sharesFilled`.
- Quote returns weighted-average price, worst fill, partial-fill status, and per-level fills.
- `get_price(...)` is not a substitute for this; it does not tell you the weighted average execution price for a sized trade.

## Ad-hoc analysis scripts (copy/paste)

### Search a topic and print tradable candidates

```python
import asyncio
from wayfinder_paths.mcp.scripting import get_adapter
from wayfinder_paths.adapters.polymarket_adapter.adapter import PolymarketAdapter

def is_tradable(m: dict) -> bool:
    return bool(m.get("enableOrderBook") and m.get("clobTokenIds") and m.get("acceptingOrders") and m.get("active") and not m.get("closed"))

async def main():
    a = await get_adapter(PolymarketAdapter)
    ok, rows = await a.search_markets_fuzzy(query="super bowl mvp", limit=25)
    assert ok, rows
    tradable = [m for m in rows if is_tradable(m)]
    for m in tradable[:10]:
        print(m["slug"], "|", m.get("question"))
    await a.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

### “Mover” scan across an event (compute deltas from time series)

For MCP/context-light work, start with `polymarket_read(action="get_event", event_slug=..., candidate_limit=...)` and hydrate only selected candidates. Use adapter `get_event_by_slug(event_slug)` only inside bounded scripts that truly need the full market set, then pull per-outcome history with limited concurrency to avoid 429s.

```python
import asyncio, time
from wayfinder_paths.mcp.scripting import get_adapter
from wayfinder_paths.adapters.polymarket_adapter.adapter import PolymarketAdapter

def hist_points(hist: dict) -> list[tuple[int, float]]:
    pts = []
    for p in hist.get("history") or []:
        if isinstance(p, dict) and "t" in p and "p" in p:
            pts.append((int(p["t"]), float(p["p"])))
    return sorted(pts, key=lambda x: x[0])

async def main():
    a = await get_adapter(PolymarketAdapter)
    ok, ev = await a.get_event_by_slug("super-bowl-lx-mvp")
    assert ok, ev

    markets = [m for m in (ev.get("markets") or []) if isinstance(m, dict) and m.get("enableOrderBook") and m.get("clobTokenIds")]
    now = int(time.time())
    start = now - 24 * 3600

    sem = asyncio.Semaphore(6)
    async def fetch_delta(m: dict):
        ok_tid, tid = a.resolve_clob_token_id(market=m, outcome="YES")
        if not ok_tid:
            ok_tid, tid = a.resolve_clob_token_id(market=m, outcome=0)  # fallback for non-YES/NO markets
        if not ok_tid:
            return None
        async with sem:
            ok, hist = await a.get_prices_history(token_id=tid, interval=None, start_ts=start, end_ts=now, fidelity=60)
        if not ok or not isinstance(hist, dict):
            return None
        pts = hist_points(hist)
        if not pts:
            return None
        return (m.get("slug"), pts[0][1], pts[-1][1], pts[-1][1] - pts[0][1])

    rows = [r for r in await asyncio.gather(*[fetch_delta(m) for m in markets]) if r]
    rows.sort(key=lambda r: r[3], reverse=True)
    for slug, p0, p1, dp in rows[:10]:
        print(f"{slug}: {p0:.3f} -> {p1:.3f} ({dp:+.3f})")

    await a.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```
