# Changelog

## [0.11.1] - 2026-06-23

Added

1. **Sports desk-analyst workflow**: broad sports and market-edge prompts now produce a fast executable PM/HL board, a concise BUY/SELL/WATCH/SKIP shortlist, and defer heavy simulation until after candidates are selected.
2. **Sports data gateway tools**: added provider-agnostic `sports_snapshot`, `sports_backtest_state`, and hidden sports-worker provider facade support for bounded live sports data, run monitoring, and model workflows.
3. **Sports regression evals**: added coverage for World Cup prop scans, country/outright scans, fair-value delta framing, unavailable sports-tool fail-fast behavior, and HYPE/SPCX trade setup routing.

Changed

1. **Prediction-market sports routing**: broad prop scans now check real sports markets before novelty word/phrase markets, hydrate surfaced buckets before global no-edge claims, and default live player-prop reads to bounded pages.
2. **Sports edge framing**: PM/HL cross-venue gaps are treated as venue-noise and liquidity context; recommendations focus on hypothesized fair-value delta versus executable price.
3. **Research influence flow**: research signals are ledgered as evidence/context or bounded model modifiers rather than silent freehand probability jumps.

Fixed

1. **Polymarket read hydration**: price, order-book, and price-history reads can resolve exact or loose `market_slug` plus outcome when the agent does not already have a token id.
2. **Hyperliquid HIP-4 discovery**: added a dedicated outcome-market search wrapper so sports scans do not pull large unrelated perp/spot boards.
3. **Sports answer failure modes**: prompts now guard against repeated invalid sports-tool retries, unsupported model-to-market comparisons, and unscoped "no edge" conclusions.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-10

Added

1. **Polymarket v2** (#213): pUSD (V2 collateral) on Polygon with deposit wallets (#311), BRAP-routed bridge legs (#319), market-order slippage cap + AutoWrap (#326), vault-backend search (#334), and limit orders by `market_slug` + `outcome` (#424).
2. **HIP-4 outcome markets** (#239): Hyperliquid binary daily prediction contracts wired into the adapter and MCP tools — price-bucket markets (#295), named outcome markets like CPI (#388), Wayfinder builder code attached to outcome orders (#296), and collateral migrated from USDH to USDC (#386).
3. **Per-action MCP write tools** (#336, #360): `hyperliquid_execute` / `polymarket_execute` split into per-action tools (`hyperliquid_place_market_order`, `polymarket_redeem_positions`, etc.), and `core_execute` split into `onchain_swap` + `onchain_send`.
4. **Safety guards**: swap approval gate (#414), pre-flight balance guards for `onchain_swap`/`onchain_send` (#375), pUSD balance guard + collateral-suffixed deposit tools (#373), on-chain allowance polling after approval txs (#418), and Hyperliquid margin / runner monitor guardrails (#346).
5. **Pendle limit order execution** (#352): Taker fills and maker order support.
6. **Research gateway** (#301): New research SDK client and MCP tool, with sanitized Exa payloads (#425) and updated social X search response types (#376).

8. **Packs MVP and path install flows** (#131, #220, #227, #230): Wayfinder packs with applet scaffolds (#302), split remote installs, dynamic strategy loading (#387), and paths DB sync from the SDK (#390).
9. **Wallet sessions** (#186, #190, #342): TTL-based session wallets (renamed to sessions), 15-minute default TTL, instance-filtered wallet lists (#192), and local wallets blocked on hosted instances (#189).
10. **Runner upgrades**: crontab notation for jobs (#433), per-job locks replacing the global lock (#404), event-driven bulk job sync to the backend (#399), idempotent `runner start` (#183), and job-completion session notifications (#182, #238).

12. **MCP tool execution metrics** (#372, #374): Fire-and-forget metrics and per-tool latency tracking.

Changed

1. **Hyperliquid UnifiedAccount migration** (#294): Moved off dexAbstraction mode; spot↔perp USD class transfers dropped (#321), builder fee set to 5 bps (#426), QuickNode info client split out (#408) with a whitelisted info dispatcher (#371).
2. **MCP surface overhaul**: every tool namespaced as `{namespace}_{name}` (#248), resources removed and folded into tools (#247, #254), registry organized reads-before-writes (#348), `web_search`/`web_fetch` moved to `core_` (#349), and `@catch_errors` + `throw_if_*` guards across all tools (#280, #283).

4. **Backtesting**: faster runs (#427), completed-bars-only enforcement (#431), CCXT data sources allowed (#328), and clarified timing prompts (#434).
5. **Docs and agent prompts consolidated**: AGENTS.md merged into wayfinder.md (#347), default domain moved to wayfinder.ai (#393, #394), Terms cover all live domains (#395), and token id format docs clarified (#383).
6. **Constants hygiene**: inline ABIs moved into `core/constants` (#316), address checksum source-of-truth invariant (#315), Polymarket builder code hardcoded as a constant (#314).

Fixed

1. **HIP-4 order sizing** (#391, #415, #416): `usd_amount` minimum sizing corrected, `usd_amount` rejected on limit orders with an actionable error, and minimum-notional suggestions now survive lot-size rounding.
2. **Polymarket reliability**: outcome label resolved from `token_id` on market orders (#419), batch submit retried on relayer registry races (#338), unknown `wallet_label` surfaced instead of a generic error (#341), and structured Gamma errors (#398).
3. **Hyperliquid trigger orders** (#429): Non-reduce-only triggers allowed via an optional flag.
4. **Runner daemon lock contention** (#401, #403): Dropped redundant SQLite lock (WAL serializes) and cleaned up daemon locking.
5. **MCP server broken outside OpenCode instances** (#402).
6. **Duplicate `/v1` in OpenCode client URLs** (#204).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-23 (5919548c8b95964e89854a51f68cef92168710b1)

**Breaking Changes**

1. Adapter constructor signatures standardized (#101): `strategy_wallet_signing_callback` → `sign_callback`, with explicit `wallet_address` parameter. Config-based wallet resolution removed from adapter constructors.
2. BalanceAdapter now takes `main_sign_callback`/`main_wallet_address` + `strategy_sign_callback`/`strategy_wallet_address` (previously `main_wallet_signing_callback`/`strategy_wallet_signing_callback`).
3. `get_adapter()` in `mcp/scripting.py` refactored to introspect adapter `__init__` signatures — direct adapter instantiation now requires explicit parameters with no config fallback.

Added

1. Solidity contract tooling (#106): compilation via solcx (solc 0.8.26, OpenZeppelin v5), MCP tools (`compile_contract`, `deploy_contract`, `contract_execute`, `contract_get_abi`), Etherscan V2 verification, proxy ABI support, artifact persistence, and `/contract-development` skill.
2. Avantis adapter (#103): ERC-4626 avUSDC LP vault on Base with `deposit()`/`withdraw()` flows.
3. MCP strategy integration tests (#97) and hyperlend_stable_yield strategy smoke test (#98).

Changed

1. Aave V3 contract addresses stored lowercase; removed redundant checksumming helpers (#100).
2. Avantis README updated to reflect `deposit()`/`withdraw()` naming (#108).

Fixed

1. Reward APR now converted to APY before combining with base APY in Aave V3 `get_all_markets()`/`get_user_state()` (#95).
2. Slippage parameter now passed through to BRAP quote calls (#76).
3. Polymarket `_normalize_market()` no longer crashes on markets missing `outcomes`/`outcomePrices`/`clobTokenIds` fields (#92).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-16 (57da66ca33a10fd68d128c80970ac989d6addb7e)

Added

1. `from_erc20_raw()` utility in `units.py` — replaces manual `float(x) / (10 ** decimals)` patterns across adapters and strategies.
2. GitHub Actions workflow for Claude Code.

Changed

1. Replaced duplicate raw-to-float conversions in balance, boros, and projectx adapters with `from_erc20_raw()`.
2. Removed redundant `_get_strategy/main_wallet_address()` overrides in stablecoin_yield and basis_trading strategies (identical to base class).
3. Simplified `config.py` (redundant `isinstance` checks), `transaction.py` (defensive guards, bare `except`), and `projectx.py` (already-narrowed type checks).
4. Moved inline import in `runner/daemon.py` to top-level.
5. Removed self-documenting comments in pendle and boros_hype adapters/strategies.
6. Polymarket CLOB URL switched from proxy to official endpoint (`clob.polymarket.com`).
